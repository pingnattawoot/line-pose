# Little Brown Book Shop

I was assigned to implement a POS(Point of Sale) system for our client who own a shop name "Little Brown Book Shop". They need a precise system, easy to use and also elegant user interface.

This Project are implemented in `Veu.js` and this is **my first time** building web application using this framework. (I use ReactJS for 2.5 years before)

This project, I use the `Vue CLI` to create the project and these are the libraries I chose to use

##### Production

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) as a core framework
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) for state management in the application
- [Vuelidate](https://monterail.github.io/vuelidate/) Simple, lightweight model-based validation for Vue.js

##### Development

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (typed superset of JavaScript)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) Next generation JavaScript compiler
- [EsLint]() Pluggable JavaScript linter
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) the code formatter
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) a very good JavaScript Testing Framework
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for hosting this application

and etc.
